## [](#header-2)Three Years Fifteen

_“'Mitch', he said, 'the culture doesn't encourage you to think about such things until you're about to die. We're so wrapped up with egotistical things, career, family, having enough money, meeting the mortgage, getting a new car, fixing the radiator when it breaks - we're involved in trillions of little acts just to keep going. So we don't get into the habit of standing back and looking at our lives and saying, Is this all? Is this all I want? Is something missing?'”_ _- Tuesdays With Morrie_

Think. Think. What do I really want from my life? What do I want when I strip away everything that the culture encourages me to want? All our trillions of little acts keep us moving forward, and we keep running, and running, but to where?
