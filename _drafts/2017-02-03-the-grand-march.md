## [](#header-2)The Grand March

_“Since the days of the French Revolution, one half of Europe has been referred to as the left, the other half as the right. Yet to define one or the other by means of the theoretical principles it professes is all but impossible. And no wonder: political movements rest not so much on rational attitudes as on the fantasies, images, words, and archetypes that come together to make up this or that political kitsch... What makes a leftist a leftist is not this or that theory but his ability to integrate any theory into the kitsch called the Grand March.”_ _- The Unbearable Lightness of Being_

We don't align with a particular party, or label, so much as we agree with the ideal that it represents. Then we fit everything that we do into this ideal.

I had a discussion today with a professor about his research on how people make strategic decisions. He has found that broadly, the strategies of solar companies can be divided into two groups and their classification depending on whether the founder considers himself an <em>environmentalist</em> or a <em>businessman</em>. In the solar industry, there are multiple moving parts: manufacturing, distribution, marketing, finance, and so on. Environmentalists are far more likely to partner with other companies that perform functions along this value chain while businessmen tend to consolidate these functions within their own firms. _Note: The firms that these environmentalists partner with are not usually the best at their craft; they don't seem to be that particular._ This means that as time goes by, the firms run by environmentalists tend to become much more specialized than those run by businessmen. And businessman-run firms tend to have a larger impact on the solar industry over the long run.

The 'Grand March' of the environmentalist (saving the planet) is fundamentally different from that of the businessman (profit) and this results in two completely different viewpoints and outcomes of the same action (starting a solar company).

We are unusually good at justifying our actions. It's all in the name of the Grand March.
