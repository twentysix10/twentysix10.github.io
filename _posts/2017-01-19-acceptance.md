## [](#header-2)Acceptance

There's a lot of talk these days about being "accepting" of others, much of it coming from my generation (the millenials). But if you really think about it, the word "accept" implies inferiority. It means "I am better but I'm going to recognize your validity out of the goodness of my heart." 

Maybe a better word would be "embrace" or "welcome".
