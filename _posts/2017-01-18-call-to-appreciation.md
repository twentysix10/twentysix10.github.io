## [](#header-2)Call to Appreciation

“Death is always on the way, but the fact that you don’t know when it will arrive seems to take away from the finiteness of life. It’s that terrible precision that we hate so much. But because we don’t know, we get to think of life as an inexhaustible well. Yet everything happens a certain number of times, and a very small number, really. How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood, some afternoon that’s so deeply a part of your life without it? Perhaps four or five times more. Perhaps not even. How many more times will you watch the full moon ruse? Perhaps twenty. And yet it all seems limitless.” _- The Sheltering Sky_

Our new roommate was involved in a car accident last year that put him in a coma for a few weeks and took him out of school for a semester. And now that he’s back he has an intense appreciation for life. We were chatting and I mentioned that making your bed is the first accomplishment of the day, and he said “no, the first accomplishment is getting out of bed and being alive.”

Well. Haven’t thought about it that way before.

This isn’t meant to be depressing – it’s more a call to appreciation.
