## [](#header-2)If I

If I could,

I would tell you<br/>
How much I want to fight for you<br/>
I would go to war if you asked<br/>
How my heart can't let you go<br/>
And my mind is nodding along<br/>
For once.<br/>
How heavy my tags feel around my neck<br/>
And not yours<br/>
How icy cold I feel.<br/>
It starts from my hands<br/>
Then swells fast to fill the forgotten parts of my body<br/>
And just as it becomes impossible to bear

I go numb

I would tell you<br/>
In a sense<br/>
This was good for me<br/>
I see what's important now<br/>
A little more clearly at least<br/>
And I'm a little bit older.<br/>
But more than ever now<br/>
You make sense to me<br/>
And I've always held out hope

But I saw you<br/>
Hand in someone else's<br/>
(You didn't see me)<br/>
And you looked happy<br/>
You looked happy.<br/>
I can't take that away<br/>
If that is what you need

If<br/>
When your head hits the pillow<br/>
I'm not completely gone<br/>
(I know you're trying to forget)<br/>
Know that neither are you.<br/>
But if I am,

Then to him<br/>
She is the best woman that I know<br/>
She deserves better than I gave<br/>
My mistake<br/>
Treat her well<br/>
Make her happy<br/>
She is a beautiful soul<br/>
Protect it fiercely<br/>
Always.

And<br/>
Hey.<br/>
Wouldn't trade a day.
