## [](#header-2)If I

If I could,

I would tell you
How much I want to fight for you
I would go to war if you asked
How my heart can't let you go
And my mind is nodding along
For once.
How heavy my tags feel around my neck
And not yours
How icy cold I feel.
It starts from my hands
Then swells fast to fill the forgotten parts of my body
And just as it becomes impossible to bear

I go numb

I would tell you
In a sense
This was good for me
I see what's important now
A little more clearly at least
And I'm a little bit older.
But more than ever now
You make sense to me
And I've always held out hope

But I saw you
Hand in someone else's
(You didn't see me)
And you looked happy
You looked happy.
I can't take that away
If that is what you need

If
When your head hits the pillow
I'm not completely gone
(I know you're trying to forget)
Know that neither are you.
But if I am,

Then to him
She is the best woman that I know
She deserves better than I gave
My mistake
Treat her well
Make her happy
She is a beautiful soul
Protect it fiercely
Always.

And
Hey.
Wouldn't trade a day.
