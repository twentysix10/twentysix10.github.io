## [](#header-2)Mummy & Papa

For the past 25 years, you've been a rock, you've been voices of reason. Thank you for raising me to become a man, for so many sacrifices, for so many worries. When I was small, you worried about me being able to read, so you bought me "one one is the sun" and I learned to read. Then you worried about getting me into primary school. Then in Thailand, my ability to speak Chinese, so you got me a tutor and we watched "Sun Wu Kong" every Saturday. When we got to Texas and Virginia, you spent so much effort making sure Jane and I went to good schools. And had a good community around us. And I was unaware of it all. Then in the army, in college, now, I'm sure I don't call enough, I don't text enough, but I know you're always there no matter what and no matter when. Thank you for accepting my mistakes, embracing my failures, and picking me up and guiding me when I have no idea where I'm headed. It's been 25 years of change, and you've been the constant throughout. For the longest time, I saw you as superman and superwoman, capable of anything, but as I grew older, I started to understand how vulnerable you were, just as much as I am. And that made everything you've done for me so much more powerful. To the two people I hope I grow up to become like, happy 25 years.
