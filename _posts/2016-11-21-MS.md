## [](#header-2)Maha

Remember you used to find me annoying in India when we first started hanging out? Glad that's changed. You've been such a big part of my development in so many ways. You taught me how to work out and stopped me from being skinny, you taught me how to thrive in the army. But even more than that, one thing I've never said but I admire so much about you is your determination to chase your passion despite what others think. And with that drive you become the best at what you do. I want to learn that and I would like to be like that one day. I'll get there. Until then, thank you for showing me what to strive for. To many more years Maha.
