## [](#header-2)John Doggett

Prof, you already know the impact that you've had on me. Thank you for challenging me to think, for teaching me to question everything. Thank you for helping me see objectively when I'm clouded by emotion. And although I might not agree with you sometimes, I know that at the end of the day, you care dearly about me and have my best interests at heart. Without a doubt, you have been essential in making me who I am today. And for that, I am incredibly grateful.
