## [](#header-2)In Hindsight

Hindsight is beautifully cruel, isn't she? All day long she's a slumbering giant, sleeping with the tiniest hint of a cheeky smile on her face. Silent, unobtrusive, unnoticed. She lets you live your life uninterrupted, make mistakes, move on, and forget. And just when you think you've moved on, she stirs. It's not a sudden awakening, like a jolt awake from a dream where you were falling. She rises slowly like the sun on a lazy summer morning. An orange glow peeking over the horizon, timidly competing with the still-bright moon for attention. Now she gathers the courage to explore a little more, and the birds begin to pay attention. Now the moon retreats. And now she bathes the world in a harsh, inescapable, light. At the perfectly wrong time, Hindsight gleefully reveals to you everything you wanted to know, everything you did wrong, and then she takes you on her twisted joy ride of whys and what-ifs and could've beens.

I see now that everything you said was true. I was just too proud to admit it then. I was selfish, and I took you for granted, and I wasn't the man that you needed me to be. I'm sorry. I hope you find someone that deserves you and makes you happy again. I know that right now, I'm not the person that can do that and I have to accept that. And I hope that whoever that is, he will never hurt you like I did.

I suppose that with time, Hindsight will return to her slumber, like the sun in the evening, and her harshness will soften. But although she'll fade, she'll live on as the sun in the moon. And that's where her cruelty lies: she never lets you forget.
