## [](#header-2)Neil Yap

Moving around every two years, I never really developed long-term friendships. But somehow, against all odds, this one's lasted. 12 years it's lasted. That's half my age. We've literally been friends for half my life. And I must admit, it's through no effort of my own. Thank you for never giving up on our friendship. From getting over my first breakup, to starting bands together, to exploring New York, to actually talking about grown-up subjects, we've come such a long way. Thanks for being that steady presence that I can always count on. You're going to do great things, and I'm going to be watching proudly.
