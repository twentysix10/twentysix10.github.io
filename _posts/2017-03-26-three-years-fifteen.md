## [](#header-2)Three Years Fifteen

Lord grant me peace and quiet my heart.

How does a soul come to peace with a decision? I pray, my soul, come to peace with surrendering three years fifteen days. Three years fifteen days of her, three years fifteen days of us, of joy, of tears, of battle, three years fifteen days of unquestioning, unreserved love.

Thank you for giving me your whole heart and for not holding back. I know you were scared to, and I was scared to have it too. But you caved, and I fell hopelessly into you. And from that moment on I was scared to lose your heart. Thank you for back scratches, for interrupted sneezes, for clean socks, for every time you fell for my sarcasm, and for earning all the respect I have to give and more. And thank you for the stairs on the wall of the church.

It's hard for me to talk to you now; it really is. But it's even harder not to. And it's taking every fiber of my being not to come running back. But you've always known exactly what I was thinking so I'm sure you already guessed that. And you also know that every time I told you that I loved you, it was an aching, insuppressible truth.

I wouldn't have traded those three years fifteen days for anything. I wouldn't have traded one year, one month, one day, one second, for all the world. But chapters all come to an end, and this one's done for now. Time to turn the page.

The package you sent me is waiting at the post office. The truth is I'm terrified of opening it. I don't want those pieces of my heart back because they would close this chapter. I hope this was the right decision, and that we both find what we need. Be good, Beebette, I'll talk to you soon. Finger boop.

Bye, love.
