## [](#header-2)Yiwen Xu

A thousand things to say, a hundred ways to say each one. I never told you before but I'm sure you know. You have had a profound impact on my life and on my development. I would not be half the man I am today without you. You guided me through college. You taught me how to truly love. You showed me what sacrifice meant each week you drove to Austin. You showed me what unconditional meant every single day. You believed in me far more than I believed in myself, and you were always right. You taught me what it meant to actually care, when you planned New Orleans. You taught me the meaning of compassion with your heart for your students. You made me a man. Even till now, you are teaching me the meaning of serving God with your life.

I remember you teaching me what a DCF was for the first time. We were in a car and I was superbly confused and you just kept saying it was simple and that I'd get it eventually. Well you were right and I got it eventually. Do you remember fidit? And teaming up to take down those people that tried to sell us a vacation package in my dorm? And the Black Dog Coffee Shop at the foot of Andre's apartment downtown? And Kinsolving, and Cafe du Monde?

I am forever grateful that I had the chance to have you in my life. You were a gift. Thank you, Yiwen, for being you.
