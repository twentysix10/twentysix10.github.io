## [](#header-2)Other Thoughts on Siddhartha

It would make sense to read [this post]({% post_url 2017-01-19-on-ithaka %}) first.

### [](#header-3)On Wisdom
Along Siddhartha's journey, he realizes the difference between knowledge and wisdom. Knowledge can be taught but ultimately, it does not satisfy. Wisdom, on the other hand, is elusive and is the most valuable.

A quick Google search defines "wisdom" as "the soundness of an action or decision with regard to the application of experience, knowledge, and good judgment." Key word <em>application</em>. How can we be wise? By reflecting on what we have learned, honestly analyzing what motivates our actions, and time.

### [](#header-3)On Reservation of Judgment
Siddhartha has many teachers, among them a courtesan, gamblers, and a merchant. None are "holy" but all bring him closer to finding peace. This is a reminder to withhold judgment - there is something to be learned from everyone, even if we don't see it at the time.

### [](#header-3)On Finding Peace
The courtesan had peace, the ferryman had peace, Gotama had peace, and finally Siddhartha had peace. Peace, it seems, comes in fully embracing yourself, in being at home being exactly who you are.
