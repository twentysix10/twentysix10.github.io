## [](#header-2)Jane Ong

I hope I've been a good big brother to you. We've had our fair share of quarrels over silly stuff as all siblings do, but I know that at the end of the day you've got my back and I've got yours. Because we moved so much, you became such a big part of my childhood because each other was all we had for a long time. Remember kick scootering around the estate and making ant-killing potions in Thailand, building a go-kart that didn't work in Barbary Walk, and stopping our stopwatches every time we'd switch players on maplestory in Island View? Good old memories and I'm sure there will be many more. I'm very proud of how you've grown, and I'm very excited about where you're going (I tell people all the time that you're much smarter than me - Mummy still won't tell me your SAT scores because she's worried I might get jealous - and I mean it) So as I turn 25 years old, thanks for being there for the last 23 and a half.
