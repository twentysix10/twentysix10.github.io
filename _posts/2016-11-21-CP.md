## [](#header-2)Cam Powell

Hands down, you are one of the people I respect the most in my life, and I am not exaggerating when I say that. I have grown in so many ways just by having you in my life, and there is so much more I want to learn from you. You are grounded in your faith, and it was because of you that I began going back to church regularly. I love to remember those Sundays, driving in your jeep with the windows down, country music blasting. You know exactly what is important to you, you go out and get it, and the opinions of others have never affected you all that much. That is something that I still need to learn. I am proud to have you as a friend Cam. Kill it over at LSE, and come back soon to celebrate.
