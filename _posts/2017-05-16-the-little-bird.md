## [](#header-2)The Little Bird

_“How can you ever be prepared to die? 'Do what the Buddhists do. Every day, have a little bird on your shoulder that asks, is today the day? Am I ready? Am I doing all I need to do? Am I being the person I want to be?'”_ _- Tuesdays With Morrie_

I've been thinking about this for a while. Am I living my life the way I would if today was the day that I die? To tell the truth, not really. This has become especially relevant given the stabbing that happened a couple of weeks back at school. Through this lens, frivilous distractions such as social media become vulgar time-burners. Staying in bed reading about "what character from Game of Thrones are you?" loses its charm. Relationships undergo re-evaluation, and we discover a newfound appreciation of life's little gifts. A cool breeze skipping from tree to tree, birds calling, squirrels chasing. And we realize what we value. For me, it's giving back. If I'm going to lose everything anyway, why not give out as much love as I can possibly give and more?

I talked to a friend today and he mentioned that I should have a view of who I want to be five years from now, and every decision that I make right now should be one that takes me one step closer to becoming that person. That should be my role model. And if my decisions are based on this framework, when the little bird calls, I will be ready. So Jon, who is that man?

Little bird, is today the day?
