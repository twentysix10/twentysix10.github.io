## [](#header-2)Gordon Tsai

So I'm the sentimental half of our pair. And you're the logical one. You've been a constant voice of reason in my life since we started rooming together, and I thank you for that. You know better than anyone else how emotionally-driven I am, and how important it is that I have you there. You've gotten me through some tough spots, and you keep getting me through them. In the grand scheme of 25 years, 3 years doesn't seem like much, but trust me when I say you've been critical in making me who I am today. I'm glad your first impression of me didn't last. And look - I ended up in a job where I actually do some simple math, so maybe I'm not that bad after all. To the best roommate I've had - thank you for these past few years, and for the journey ahead.
