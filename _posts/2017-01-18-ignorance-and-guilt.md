## [](#header-2)Ignorance & Guilt

“But, he said to himself, whether they knew or didn’t know is not the main issue; the main issue is whether a man is innocent because he didn’t know. Is a fool on the throne relieved of all responsibility merely because he is a fool?” _- The Unbearable Lightness of Being_

If a person is not aware of his crime when he does it, does it make him innocent? Communism was started by idealists, not criminals. In the pursuit of the general wellbeing, people had to be killed. Years later, are the founders of the movement guilty or does their ignorance at the time absolve them? Was Oedipus justified in clawing out his eyes at the guilt of having unknowingly murdered his father and married his mother?

I believe all humans have an innate sense of right and wrong – is it possible to violate that unknowingly?

Guilt and intention are two separate concepts. A person can be guilty and have the best intentions. Is stealing bread from a store to feed a starving family justified? Is the thief guilty?
