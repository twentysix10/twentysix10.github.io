## [](#header-2)This Is Why

_Tokyo - 23:49_

Doggett said to never beg anyone to love you, so I'm banking on the fact that you're probably never going to read this.

Whenever you - or anyone else - asked why I loved you before, I always tried to avoid the question. Or I'd come up with a cop-out answer, because it was a question that required a lot of reflection and I never really bothered to reflect that much before. It's ironic (and if you were the protagonist in a novel it'd be a "karma's a you-know-what" kind of ending) that only after letting you go did I realize exactly why I love you and what giving you up would mean.

We got complacent in our relationship. We both see it now. It required so much effort for the two of us to be together that there was no energy left for us to grow as individuals. 200 miles and two different stages of life for two years wore us down. And it's funny how it's over now, just as we're about to be two miles apart, in the same stage of life, both discovering a new city and a new job. It would have worked, I know.

So someone asked me again recently why I think you're my forever. Asked me why I love you. And seeing you over the last two days reminded me why. Seeing you as you are now - _empathetic_ (you were thrown into a completely foreign situation with teaching and so quickly you grew to understand and love your students), _driven_ (to help solve the low income community housing issue), _so caring_, _so brave_, _strong_ (at least stronger than I am) _in your faith_, _aligning with my values_ (love God, love family, help others), _minimalist_, _just a little bit naive_, _the way you can't sneeze when you get distracted_, _the way your whole body absolutely lights up when you get excited_ - and having experienced over the past three years the amount of love and support you have given to me (you told me once that I loved you when you couldn't love yourself. You have done that for me and so much more), there is no question. This woman right now is the woman that I want to 1) become more like, 2) raise my children with, and 3) be with for the rest of my life. And I don't think that there is anyone else in my life besides my family that I have ever cared so intensely about.

You said that you need someone who has the same passions that you do. And that is where you find your best friends. But passions change. Friends change. Values don't. A life partner doesn't. You don't think love alone is enough to make it work. I agree. It's love and value alignment and intellectual engagement and a commitment to making it work that we need. Just look at my parents.

I've got a new crush on the same girl. I took you for granted before. I lost you twice and got you back once. I'll never beg anyone to love me but, if the little bird on my shoulder says "today is the day", then at least I got this out. It's not a life that I can love without you in it.

I fear the truth is that in your mind, I could never compare to him. I was a way to numb the pain. It's true, you never lose your first love.
