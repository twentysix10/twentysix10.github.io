## [](#header-2)Annie Xue

Pretty crazy how we became close friends. Two confused kids trying to climb out of the holes we'd dug ourselves into. Would you believe that at one point, I actually thought I was mentoring you? Turns out I was the one learning and I was the one growing. I appreciate you. Thank you for listening to me and telling me what my horoscope says, for being as much of a mess as me sometimes so I don't feel alone, and just for being present. And for the Kit & Port designs. We'd be nowhere without you. You're going to do some incredible things in design and I'm so excited for you. I'll be cheering you on the whole time.
