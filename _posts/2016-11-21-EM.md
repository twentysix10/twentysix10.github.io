## [](#header-2)Erik Margetis

Man we've had a pretty crazy journey together. For one, reflecting on the last 25 years, Kit & Port is such a large part of what defines me, and you're such a large part of Kit & Port, that by definition you've had a profound impact on my life. Without you, I wouldn't have tried to start this. But even aside from that, thanks for being one of the absolute best guys I could ever be around. From almost winning the softball championship to flying around on scooters in Vietnam to listening to my complaining, we've definitely made some memories that I never want to forget. We've had our fair share of disagreements, but know that I have always had a huge amount of respect for your opinion. From two freshmen talking about shoes to a guy with a wannabe lumberjack beard and one old dude, I've enjoyed every single step. Sole-mates.
