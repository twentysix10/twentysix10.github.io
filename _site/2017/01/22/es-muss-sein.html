      <h2 id="es-muss-sein"><a href="#header-2"></a>Es Muss Sein</h2>

<p><em>“Even then, her words had left Tomas in a strange state of melancholy, and now he realized it was only a matter of chance that Tereza loved him and not his friend Z. Apart from her consummated love for Tomas, there were, in the realm of possibility, an infinite number of unconsummated loves for other men.</em></p>

<p><em>We all reject out of hand the idea that the love of our life may be something light or weightless; we presume our love is what must be, that without it our life would no longer be the same; we feel that Beethoven himself, gloomy and awe-inspiring, is playing the ‘Es muss sein!’ to our own great love.</em></p>

<p><em>Tomas often thought of Tereza’s remark about his friend Z. and came to the conclusion that the love story of his life exemplified not ‘Es muss sein!’ (It must be so), but rather ‘Es könnte auch anders sein’ (It could just as well be otherwise).”</em> <em>- The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em></p>

<p>The vast majority of the events that happen in our life are the result of a fortunate series of coincidences. My future full-time job is largely a product of my college experience. But I would not be at the college I am at if not for a good friend I made in high school. I would not have made that good friend if I had not joined the cross country team. I would not have been on the cross country team if I had made a fuss about not being allowed to be a sprinter (which was my original goal). I would not have thought about trying running in the first place if I had not noticed that cheerleaders ran track in the off-season and I felt that it would be nice to date a cheerleader.</p>

<p>So the future of my professional career is the tail end of a chain of events sparked by a teenage boy’s puberty-charged snap decision.</p>

<p>When everything in our life could just as well be otherwise, meaning that they could just as well not have happened, does that <em>diminish</em> or <em>increase</em> their value? On one hand, you could argue that the fact that so many separate events had to coincide means that it really wasn’t meant to be, that the event had to fight tooth and nail against every obstacle the world put up against it to force its way into your path. It was not what nature wanted. ‘Es sollte anders sein!’ (It should be otherwise). But on the other hand, you could say that this event is so much more important <em>because</em> so many impossible coincidences had to occur. No matter what the world threw at it, nothing could stop it from happening. ‘Es muss sein!’</p>

<p>I don’t know the answer, and I don’t think it’s important that I do. But I think that in each of us there is a romantic idealism, that secretly believes that what has happened was meant to be. This gives us hope that maybe the responsibility of what happens in our life does not rest wholly upon our shoulders, because that is too unbearable to imagine.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Que Sera, Sera,<br />
Whatever will be, will be<br />
The future’s not ours, to see<br />
Que Sera, Sera,<br />
What will be, will be<br /></p>
