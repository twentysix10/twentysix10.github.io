      <h2 id="creation--consumption"><a href="#header-2"></a>Creation &amp; Consumption</h2>

<p>I came across <a href="http://www.living-intentionally.com/2013/02/03/creation-vs-consumption/" target="_blank">this article</a> after discussing the topic seperately with a couple of friends. We spend the majority of our lives consuming content, and taking as much as we can from the world around us. And we do it because it’s easy. But if that’s the case, then we start to become the product of someone else’s mind. Our opinions are not really our own opinions, and our decisions are not really our own decisions. We don’t think critically or properly analyze anything, simply because we don’t see the need to.</p>

<p>I can see this happening in myself every day, and that’s why I started this blog. I’m trying to work towards rebalancing the consumption-creation seesaw in favor of creation. I’m trying to train my mind to think, and analyze, and critique, and question, instead of accepting and agreeing with everything at its face value. I find that when I read articles and books with the intention of writing down reflections on them, I am forced to actually <em>read</em> and <em>think</em> about them before moving on.</p>

<p>My writing is not the best, but it will get better. My phrasing is sub-par at best, but it will improve. My thoughts are not the most coherent, but that’s because I’m a little rusty from a lifetime of consuming.</p>

<p>I’ve told people before that I want to leave the world a better place than the one I was born into. Here’s the first step.</p>
