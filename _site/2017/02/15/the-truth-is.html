      <h2 id="the-truth-is"><a href="#header-2"></a>The Truth Is,</h2>

<p>I’m afraid to see my parents cry. I wouldn’t know what to do. They’re supposed to be the strong ones.</p>

<p>The truth is, I’ve been away for almost eleven years. Even when I was close I was away. Why worry? I’d be there at the end. I had my life to live. And you had yours to live.</p>

<p>The truth is, when I think of you I remember New Jersey at six, throwing a football. I thought it was a rugby ball. I remember Taiwan. I didn’t talk to you too much that trip. I remember your trivia at family dinners. We’d sit through it in a circle on the floor because it was important to you. My Chinese was so bad I hardly knew what was going on, but I won a dollar for a correct answer once. I spent it going to the gym. And then I remember last year in the hospital. How it reminded me that I’ve been away for almost eleven years. I remember you were afraid of death, and when I saw you I was afraid of him too, because I thought it was time. But then I left and you were fine.</p>

<p>So when I got the text last night saying that your heart stopped I didn’t believe it until this morning. I knew it, but my heart resisted. <em>“When the heart speaks, the mind finds it indecent to object.”</em> But this morning my mind objected and my heart conceded. You were afraid of death, but I hope he was kind to you. I pray that God took you back and that you have peace now. Yeye, I miss you intensely and I love you more than you know.</p>

<p>I’m waiting for my flight from San Francisco to Singapore. It’s ironic that the only time we dropped everything for you, no questions asked, is right now. I’ll be in Singapore in a few hours to see you one last time, and I think you would have liked knowing that you brought the whole family together once more. It’s rare these days.</p>

<p>So do I smile when I land? Say “it’s good to see you” to my family? because the truth is it’s not. Not like this. I’m afraid for my family to see me cry; I’m afraid that they’ll cry. But the truth is, it would be worse if they didn’t.</p>
