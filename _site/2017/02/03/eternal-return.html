<p><em>“Any schoolboy can do experiments in the physics laboratory to test various scientific hypotheses. But man, because he has only one life to live, cannot conduct experiments to test whether to follow his passion (compassion) or not.”</em> <em>- The Unbearable Lightness of Being</em></p>

<p>The schoolboy is able to test multiple decisions, see all their different outcomes, and come to the logical conclusion that one decision is the optimal decision. That’s what an experiment is. But because we are only given one chance to live our life, we are only given one chance to make each decision. And so we can never know if the decisions that we make are optimal. Did I choose the right partner? The right job? We make a best guess, grit our teeth, and charge ahead.</p>

<p>But, if we were allowed to repeat each day, and month, and year, and decade, of our lives as many times as we want, with full memory of each repetition, do you think that we would pick the best choice? Given infinitely repeatable choices, will we make the optimal decision?</p>

<p>Motivation is a curious thing. Ask any school teacher who has to motivate hundreds of students every day. The difficulty is that we are primed to be infinitely more concerned with the short-term than with the long-term. And this is reflected in our actions. The high schooler knows, theoretically, that if he studies hard and does well in class, he will be accepted to a good college and he will get a good job and he will have a good life. That’s the long-term goal. But instead, the majority of the decisions made are based on ‘how, in the next five seconds, can I make myself as cool as possible to my peers?’ Short-term satisfaction beats out long-term.</p>

<p>So back to the question. Given infinitely repeatable choices, will we make the long-run optimal decision on that final iteration? My suspicion is no. My suspicion is that when it comes down to decision time, the monkey-brain in us takes over and satisfies the short-term.</p>

<p>Maybe eternal return doesn’t work on us.</p>
